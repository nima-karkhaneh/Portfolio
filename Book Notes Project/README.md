# Virtual Bookroom (Book Notes Project)

## Overview
**Virtual Bookroom** is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage their collection of book reviews. Users can add books with details such as title, author, ISBN, review, star rating, and the date they read the book. Book cover images are fetched dynamically from the Open Library API to enrich the experience. While the app does not implement user authentication, it captures the readerâ€™s name with each review to provide basic identification. The library supports sorting by date, rating, or alphabetically for easy browsing.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
* **Embedded JavaScript (EJS):** To structure the content of the website and add some functionality
* **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):** To style the content of the website including a responsive design
* **JavaScript:** To add extra functionality to the website
### Backend
* **Node.js**: To run JavaScript on the server-side of the application
### Database
* **PostgresSQL**: To create a database for the web application
### APIs
* **Open Library API**: To access book covers

## Dependencies
* **dotenv**: To store sensitive information like the database credentials or API keys
* **express**: To build server-side of the application
* **ejs**: To enable Embedded JavasScript
* **pg**: To interact with the PostgresSQL from the backend

## Installation Guide
### Book Notes Project
This project is located in the `Book Notes Project` directory of a larger repository called `Portfolio`. It requires a `.env` file and a PostgreSQL database to run.
To install and use the project, please follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nima-karkhaneh/Portfolio.git
cd "Book Notes Project"

```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Launch **pgAdmin** and connect to your PostgreSQL server. Create a new database followed by creating the following two tables:
```
CREATE TABLE library (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
title VARCHAR(50),
author VARCHAR(50),
isbn BIGINT,
date CHAR(10),
review TEXT,
rate INT
);

CREATE TABLE rating (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
rate INT
);

```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and replace the placeholders with your local PostgreSQL credentials. Here is an example for your `.env` file:
```
DB_USER="Your PostgreSQL username (usually postgress unless you specified another)"
DB_HOST="localhost"
DB_DATABASE="The name of your database (e.g., my_project_db)"
DB_PASSWORD="Your PostgreSQL password"
DB_PORT="5432"
PORT="3000"

```
5. Run the application:  

`node index.js `  

6. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start the application
## Credit
This project was developed independently as a capstone assignment for **The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** by **Angela Yu (The App Brewery)**. While inspired by course objectives, all implementation decisions, styling, and additional features (like error handling and UI improvements) were completed by myself.
